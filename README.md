# Chocolate-sales-report

I've been working on a Power BI report "Chocolate Sale Report". 
Here are the steps that helped me create this insightful report:

Data Loading & Transformation: Used Power Query to get the data ready. 

DAX_Measures: Created measures to analyze the data. 

Date_Table & Time_Intelligence: Added these to track trends over time. 

KPIs: Focused on key metrics like sales, orders, profit, profit margin, and discount. 

Report Design: Designed the report with a custom background. 

Visualizations: Included charts for sales by country, product, segment, discount, profit margin by year & month, profit by product, and a detailed table. 

Filter Pane: This was a game-changer! I used bookmarks, buttons, and selections to create an interactive filter pane. This approach provides the report with an app-like view, making the user interface simple and easy to understand and use. üñ±Ô∏èüìë

Key Insights:

October 2013 Profit Margin: Lower than September 2013, possibly because cheaper milk chocolates sold more than premium dark chocolates.

Top Sales Region: The United States had the highest sales.

Top Products: Bournville, Cadbury Dairy Milk Mousse, and Cadbury Dairy Milk Wholenut were the best sellers. 

Chocolate Types: Dark chocolate had the highest sales, followed by milk and white chocolates. 
Using bookmarks, buttons, and selections for the filter pane made the report super interactive and user-friendly. This approach really brought the data to life and made it easy to explore different aspects of the sales data. üåü
